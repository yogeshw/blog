# Namdapha Tiger Reserve: A Pristine Wilderness in Eastern India

Nestled in the eastern-most corner of India, Namdapha Tiger Reserve stands as a testament to the country's rich biodiversity. Spanning over 1,985 square kilometers in Arunachal Pradesh, this pristine wilderness represents one of the last frontiers of untamed nature in South Asia.

## A Unique Ecological Niche

What makes Namdapha truly remarkable is its exceptional altitudinal range, from 200 meters to over 4,500 meters above sea level. This dramatic elevation gradient creates a diverse array of habitats, from tropical moist forests in the lower reaches to snow-capped peaks in the higher elevations.

## Biodiversity Hotspot

### Flora
The reserve hosts an incredible variety of vegetation types:
- Tropical wet evergreen forests
- Subtropical rainforests

## Conservation Challenges

Despite its remote location, Namdapha faces several conservation challenges:

1. **Human Encroachment**: Traditional hunting practices and settlement expansion
2. **Poaching**: Illegal wildlife trade threatening endangered species
3. **Infrastructure Development**: Road projects potentially fragmenting habitats
4. **Climate Change**: Affecting altitudinal species distribution

## Conservation Initiatives
